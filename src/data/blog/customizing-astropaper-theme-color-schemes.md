# Introduction

Stargazing is one of the most accessible ways to connect with the night sky. Whether you're in a city with light pollution or under pristine rural skies, there’s always something wondrous to observe.

## Why Stargaze?

- **Connection to history**: Humans have charted the stars for millennia.  
- **Relaxation**: A quiet night under the stars can be deeply meditative.  
- **Learning opportunity**: From constellations to planetary motions, there’s always more to explore.

## Essential Gear

1. **Eyes**: Your best “telescope” is free and always at the ready.  
2. **Smartphone app**: Apps like SkyView or Stellarium help you identify celestial objects.  
3. **Binoculars**: A simple 7×50 pair will reveal more stars and some deep‑sky objects.

```js
// Quick demo: fetch a list of visible constellations from your own API
import { getConstellations } from '../lib/sky';

async function showTonightSky() {
  const constellations = await getConstellations();
  console.log('Visible constellations:', constellations);
}

showTonightSky();
